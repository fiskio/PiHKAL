  Abstract                 = {Recurrent neural network is a powerful model that learns temporal patterns in
sequential data. For a long time, it was believed that recurrent networks are
difficult to train using simple optimizers, such as stochastic gradient
descent, due to the so-called vanishing gradient problem. In this paper, we
show that learning longer term patterns in real data, such as in natural
language, is perfectly possible using gradient descent. This is achieved by
using a slight structural modification of the simple recurrent neural network
architecture. We encourage some of the hidden units to change their state
slowly by making part of the recurrent weight matrix close to identity, thus
forming kind of a longer term memory. We evaluate our model in language
modeling experiments, where we obtain similar performance to the much more
complex Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber,
1997).},

  Abstract                 = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent
performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large
labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to
sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence
learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method
uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to
a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the
target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to
French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by
the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's
BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did
not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT
system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM
to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its
BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on
this task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations
that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and
the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in
all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance
markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the
source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},
